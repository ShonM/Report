Report
======

Because I got sick of typing out my commit log and PR descriptions at the end of every day.

#### TODO

* Change organization to just "owner" so it's more clear who's doing what
* Build as phar (will allow project directory to be the cwd)
* Disable SMTP when credentials are not present, no biggie
* Refactor and document internals
* More data providers? Maybe CodeBase, HipChat, others
